I've created a step-by-step video tutorial to guide you through the process of building this responsive admin panel. **[Watch it on YouTube](https://youtu.be/_uOgXpEHNbc)**

Flutter V2.\* has officially introduced web support on its stable branch. Today, I'm excited to present a Flutter-based Admin panel, often referred to as a dashboard UI. This Flutter dashboard template, which you can find on GitHub, is a comprehensive solution for your app's backend needs. It comes with a wide array of features including charts, tables, and neatly designed info cards.

This flutter dashboard library is versatile; it's tailored to work seamlessly on the Web, macOS app, tablets, and both Android and iOS phones. The principle 'code once, run everywhere' truly comes to life with this.
